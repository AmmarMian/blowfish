      <description>Although Congo 2.0 contains a large number of changes, the theme has been designed to minimise the effort required to upgrade to the latest release.
That said, there are some changes that require adjustments to existing sites that are built with Congo version 1.</description>

      <description>Congo 2.0 is packed with tons of new features and optimisations. The original aim of Congo was to develop a theme that was simple and lightweight. Version 2 takes this one step further and makes the theme even more powerful while still maintaining its lightweight footprint.</description>
